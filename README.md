# NYAssessment

#Getting Started
-----------
### Its a simple application in which app fetch data from api and display a list of data in collection view

   
  When click on any list will show WebView in detail screen

### I have used NYTime API.  API need  API Key which you get from NYTimes and need two parameters section and timePeriod. Detail Could be seen in MostViewService in HomeviewController-> Services->

### I have used Alamofire for network calls and used Network Manager to handle all networks calls in the app. 

### Structural I made service class and service class finally gives call to network manager with parameters url and urlRequestType.
